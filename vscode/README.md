# VSCode Configs

## Installation

### Keybindings

The custom keybindings mirror keybindings in other IDEs. To install, copy the
keybindings.json file to the VSCode keybindings config:

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_advanced-customization

Open the keybindings.json file from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) with the
`Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` command.

### Config

Copy the vscode-config.json file to the VSCode config by using the command pallette
(⇧⌘P by default, and ⌘K if you installed the above keybindings) and running the
`Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` command
